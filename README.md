Just drop the StandardVertColorShader folder into your Unity3d project. 
Now in your material properties, pick either "Standard (Vertcolor)" or "Standard (Specular Setup, Vertcolor)" for your shader. 
Next, make sure the "Per-Vertex Color" option is turned on in the material properties, and you are ready to go.

Please let me know if you have any problems! Thanks!
